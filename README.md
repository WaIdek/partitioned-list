# Adneum Java Test

## Requirements

1. Write a 'partition' function that takes a parameter 'list' and a parameter
'size' and returns a list of sub-lists, where each sub-list has the maximum
'size' elements.

2. Write unit tests with Junit4 to verify your implementation.

**Important:** Assume that your implementation will be part of a library
used by many other applications (in production)
